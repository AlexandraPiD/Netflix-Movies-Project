# Netflix-Movies-Project

Investigating Netflix Movies.

This is a simple Datacamp project, and its main goal was to answer the question "Is the average duration of movies been declining?". I've used Matplotlib package to plot a subset of the data of the netflix_data.csv file and obtain an answer. After plotting and analyzing the scatter plot the answer is no, the average duration of movies is not declining.
